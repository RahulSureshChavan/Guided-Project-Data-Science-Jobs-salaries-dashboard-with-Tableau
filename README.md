7. Employment type as percentage of total.

Tasks: 
1. Download ds_salaries.csv file from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries.
2. Upload the file to Tableau public.
3. Alias the abbreviations to improve readability. Example, employment type "FT" to "Full Time".
4. Utilize specific data to build required data visualizations.
5. Club all the data visualizations into a dashboard with two filters - Job tile and Company location.
